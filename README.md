# ATE-Python-Code
Various programms developped for a project class at University. The goal is to showcase the Rayleigh and Mie Scattering of light with different diffusion solutions such as Milk, or nanometric gold particles. The repository gathers data collections, diffusion simulation and much more.

# About this project
During the 6th semester, students are to participate in experimental class during the entire semester, as an initiation of the life of a researcher in a laboratory. 

This repository contains some of useful programs I developped in order to analyze the data we obtained from a spectrophotometer. You will find in the first part the programs used in our experiment. Secondly, you'll have access to the data files used during our last experiment, and the plots we produced from that.

They are not especially efficient or useful, but the point of this repository was mainly to share them with my teachers and cite them in my report.
