Here, you can find two codes. The first one is meant to convert recorded datas structures to an adapated format for Numpy. The second is using the created arrays to generate a plot in Matplotlib.

The Numpy arrays can be found as well.

Lastly, for some reason, some labels are not showing on the graph, so :
  - xlabel : Wavelength (nm)
  - ylabel : Light intensity
