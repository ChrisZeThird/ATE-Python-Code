#About the data files

The files in this folder are raw. You can then try the different programs to see what they do and how they work. You have first to convert the comma to dots. After that you can plot those datas.

#About the programs

`Proportionality.py` Might be a bit obscure. Basically, the Rayleigh's formula of scattered light intensity can be seen as a proportionality relationship between the Intensity and the wavelength. Therefore, in order to observe that relationship, I used the natural logarithm to then plot the log of I/I0 - the ratio of I, the intensity measured after a diffusing medium, and I0, the original light intensity - depending on the log of the wavelength, to have a linear expression. The formula can be found on the wikipedia page `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering` in the section *Small size parameter approximation*.

The trend curve can be found as well, and show that the coefficient is close to `-4`, the expected value.
