Here, you can find two codes. The first one is meant to convert recorded datas structures to an adapated format for Numpy (comas conversion). The second is using the created arrays to generate a plot in Matplotlib (data plot).

The Numpy arrays and the original data files can be found as well.

A problem about iteration in dictionnaries wouldn't have been solved without the help of a comment posted by MSeifert on Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45877614/how-to-change-all-the-dictionary-keys-in-a-for-loop-with-d-items), where they explain the main issue of iteration through a dictionnary in order to change its key. So thank you for that.
